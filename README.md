Prime Factorization of two numbers in an n-dimensional space

Given two numbers
Returns the minimum dimensionality of a space representing both numbers
Where each axis is a prime factor of the number and the coordinates represent the prime factorization of the number.

Calculates the distance between the two point representations of these numbers in this space.
